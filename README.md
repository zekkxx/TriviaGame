Create a trivia game that shows a question that shows only one question until the player answers it or time runs out (That's what a trivia game is after all)
Upon success:
    Screen congratulates them, automatically moves on after a few moments.
Upon failure:
    Time runs out: "Time is up" display correct answer, move on
    Player guess wrong: Tell player they chose wrong, display correct answer, move on
On the final screen, show the number of correct/incorrect answers and option to restart game (without reloading page)
